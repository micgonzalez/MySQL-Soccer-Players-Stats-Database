# Findings

After connecting to the remote MySQL database. I converted the database into a DataFrame for exploratory data analysis. This process allows me to play around with the data and create data visualizations. After performing a few primary exploratory data analyses. I have noticed many players are taller than 180 cm (5 ft 10 inches). Performed an inner join function to combine two databases into one. Created data visualizations from the query about the player's height.

# Challenges

One major challenge that I encountered for this project was looking for the right features that could be useful based on the given guidelines. Another challenge was the size of the original DataFrame. Focusing on the areas where the insights would be aligned with the given tasks. 

# Conclusion

I was able to complete the given tasks that were listed in the introduction section. It was a little difficult to find the right features that were based on the playersâ€™ stats and seen as useful to the local soccer Facebook group. The charts will be used in an upcoming newsletter.
